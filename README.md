A House Rental Management System

A software application for managing rental properties, which provides CRUD operations for adding, updating, deleting, and viewing properties. 
It deals with three types of properties: Apartments, Houses, and Condos, and each has its own specific details. The system is designed using OOP principles to ensure maintainability, extensibility, and scalability, and to accommodate future requirements.
The system also has a report based on some condition available on the records that was created.

** A class diagram is included in the utils folder to display the various classes and the relationship that exists between them.
